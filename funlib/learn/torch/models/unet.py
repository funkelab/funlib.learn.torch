        The U-Net expects 3D or 4D tensors shaped like::

            ``(batch=1, channels, [length,] depth, height, width)``.

        This U-Net performs only "valid" convolutions, i.e., sizes of the
        feature maps decrease after each convolution. It will perfrom 4D
        convolutions as long as ``length`` is greater than 1. As soon as
        ``length`` is 1 due to a valid convolution, the time dimension will be
        dropped and tensors with ``(b, c, z, y, x)`` will be use (and returned)
        from there on.

        Args:

            in_channels:

                The number of input channels.

            num_fmaps:

                The number of feature maps in the first layer. This is also the
                number of output feature maps. Stored in the ``channels``
                dimension.

            fmap_inc_factor:

                By how much to multiply the number of feature maps between
                layers. If layer 0 has ``k`` feature maps, layer ``l`` will
                have ``k*fmap_inc_factor**l``.

            downsample_factors:

                List of tuples ``(z, y, x)`` to use to down- and up-sample the
                feature maps between layers.

            kernel_size_down (optional):

                List of lists of kernel sizes. The number of sizes in a list
                determines the number of convolutional layers in the
                corresponding level of the build on the left side. Kernel sizes
                can be given as tuples or integer. If not given, each
                convolutional pass will consist of two 3x3x3 convolutions.

            kernel_size_up (optional):

                List of lists of kernel sizes. The number of sizes in a list
                determines the number of convolutional layers in the
                corresponding level of the build on the right side. Within one
                of the lists going from left to right. Kernel sizes can be
                given as tuples or integer. If not given, each convolutional
                pass will consist of two 3x3x3 convolutions.

            activation:

                Which activation to use after a convolution. Accepts the name
                of any tensorflow activation function (e.g., ``ReLU`` for
                ``torch.nn.ReLU``).

            fov (optional):

                Initial field of view in physical units

            voxel_size (optional):

                Size of a voxel in the input data, in physical units

            num_heads (optional):

                Number of decoders. The resulting U-Net has one single encoder
                path and num_heads decoder paths. This is useful in a
                multi-task learning context.

            constant_upsample (optional):

                If set to true, perform a constant upsampling instead of a
                transposed convolution in the upsampling layers.

            padding (optional):

                How to pad convolutions. Either 'same' or 'valid' (default).
